Assessor questions:
- 7Q10 flag applied at VAHUC6 or VAHU5 level?
- 7Q10 flag dropped for lake data?
- 7Q10 flag: how do we count samples? 
   - current fix is to drop samples from quickStats() 
      so not included in X/Y analysis but 7Q10 samples
      carry through parameter analysis with special logic
      to not flag for exceedances
