# Description
This repository holds scripts that detail Virginia DEQ's (VDEQ) automated water quality assessment methodology. The automated system has been refined over four Integrated Report cycles to include estuarine, lacustrine, and riverine protocols. Major outputs of these methods include a single "stations table" output encompassing station level results for all stations sampled during a given assessment cycle. Additionally, riverine and lacustrine results may be interactively explored in custom built shiny applications to assist end users with deeper understanding of computer suggested decisions. 


## New Features for IR2024
- Statewide citizen monitoring and non-agency data incorporated into automated methods
- Statewide low flow (7Q10) flags for Aquatic Life Use parameters
- Refined estuarine analysis protocols for "conventionals" parameters


## Authors
This project is a collaboration between a few VDEQ programmers and a number of Water Quality Assessment staff. Programming is primarily divided into these categories:
- Citizen Monitoring/Non-Agency data: Reid Downer
- Overall programming assistance: Joe Famularo
- Method architecture and lead programmer: Emma Jones

## Contributing
We welcome contributions and feature requests to make these methods more applicable to other users. Please file issues to highlight requests from the community.

## Disclaimer
These tools were developed to assist with VDEQ's statewide water quality assessment process and thus are dialed specifically to meet the agency's needs. All database connections are restricted to internal users, though copies of data may be requested via email. Transparency is our goal, but without externally-facing data distribution systems we are limited in our ability to support on demand data requests.  
The scripts housed in this repository represent the best efforts of a few programmers to streamline an incredibly complicated process. These efforts have taken years to refine and will continute to iteratively improve. We welcome any issues opened that identify problems in logic or analysis results to aid in the perfection of these tools.
